#Works With

Reactive Forms without Validation Requirements as of now.

- Set max height by maxHeightPx.


#ToDo

- Custom Validation

- Custom CSS for Text Size, Box Size

- Flag for a11y dotted outline on focus

- Filter functionality based on regular expression, word match options

- Scroll Bar is currently custom style, to make it universal with Browser Look n Feel. Good to have.

- To check with Template based forms and NG Modal.

- Add Border to complete component.

- Check for scroll-padding alternatives.

- Custome keyName to read values from in place of 'name'.
